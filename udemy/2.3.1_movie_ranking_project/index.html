The Best Movies According to Victor
</h1>

<h2>
My top 3 movies of all-time.
</h2>

<hr>

<h3>
Good Will Hunting
</h3>
<p>
This is my favorite movie of all time, it features the start of Matt Damons and
Ben Afflecks start to their career and also features one of my favorites actors,
the late Robin Williams. Robin Williams role in this move was not a
comedic role but a serious role which he absolutely nailed.

<h3>
Dragon Ball Z
</h3>
<p>
The first ever anime that I have rewatched countless times. Go Goku!
</p>

<h3>
The Godfather
</h3>
<p>
A movie that was ahead of it's time with how good the quality of the film was.
